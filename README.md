# DescraPix

This project uses OpenAI's CLIP model to find images in a folder that match a user provided text description. It can analyze a folder of images, compute their similarity to a given description, and display or save the best matches.

# Technologies Used
1. **Streamlit**: For the web application interface.
2. **PyTorch**: For leveraging the CLIP model.
3. **Hugging Face Transformers**: To load the pretrained CLIP model and processor.
4. **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing.
5. **```shutil```**: For file copying and management.

# Future Improvements
1. Add support for more image formats (e.g., GIFs, BMP).

2. Enhance the user interface with drag-and-drop functionality for folder selection.

3. Integrate GPU acceleration for faster image processing.

4. Extend the application to process videos by extracting frames and performing similarity checks.
